Preseeding d-i

Preseeding provides a way to set answers to questions asked during the
installation process, without having to manually enter the answers while the
installation is running. This makes it possible to fully automate most types of
installation and even offers some features not available during normal
installations. (https://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/Preseed)
